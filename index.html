      <h2>Personal Information</h2>

      <p>My name is Cody Sadler. I am 19 years of age.The only prior study
         I have had was through primary and secondary school where I was there
         for years 1-12 however I didn't fully pass year 12 because of my difficulty
         studying through 2020 covid.However while i was at school i did happen to
         complete a Cert III in screen and media. I am currently studying intro into IT
         (Information Technology) through RMIT Universities online via Open Universities.
         My hobbies include; Technology repairs and teardowns, exploring all aspects of
         filmmaking and the production of a film or television show, consuming film, shows,
         anime and games is what i'm most likely doing throughout the day.
      </p>


      <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>

      <p>My interest in IT started relatively early in my life when I first started using a computer.
         Pretty much I was hooked on anything technology from the hardware of PCs and old gaming consoles
         used to the software they were using and the code that made the apps, games and websites I use daily.
         Until only recently my view on IT has only been as a hobby however since i completed a Cert III in
         screen and media my view changed and saw how i could make it a career. During that course one of the
         assignments was web development. What I found was pretty fun diving further than just HTML and CSS.
         I looked a little into Java just to have some fun. I chose RMIT through Open universities australia
         to pathway into a Bachelor of Computer science. During this course I hope to learn more about the
         other coding languages out there like python and c++.
