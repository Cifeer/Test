<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>My name is Cody Sadler. I am 19 years of age.The only prior study
   I have had was through primary and secondary school where I was there
   for years 1-12 however I didn't fully pass year 12 because of my difficulty
   studying through 2020 covid.However while i was at school i did happen to
   complete a Cert III in screen and media. I am currently studying intro into IT
   (Information Technology) through RMIT Universities online via Open Universities.
   My hobbies include; Technology repairs and teardowns, exploring all aspects of
   filmmaking and the production of a film or television show, consuming film, shows,
   anime and games is what i'm most likely doing throughout the day.</p>

   <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT started relatively early in my life when I first started using a computer.
   Pretty much I was hooked on anything technology from the hardware of PCs and old gaming consoles
   used to the software they were using and the code that made the apps, games and websites I use daily.
   Until only recently my view on IT has only been as a hobby however since i completed a Cert III in
   screen and media my view changed and saw how i could make it a career. During that course one of the
   assignments was web development. What I found was pretty fun diving further than just HTML and CSS.
   I looked a little into Java just to have some fun. I chose RMIT through Open universities australia
   to pathway into a Bachelor of Computer science. During this course I hope to learn more about the
   other coding languages out there like python and c++.</p>   

<h2>Ideal Job in IT Industry</h2>

<p>In this job position at Blackmagic Design you're making software and firmware for video and photo production
   that are used on hollywood movies,tv shows and music videos. You will be using Qt to code with C++ to build software
   and firmware from the ground up and you will be involved in most aspects of the softwares life cycle from conception to launch.
   I found this job would be perfect for me to work at as it focuses on my 2 favourite passions; Filmmaking and IT. It's just perfect,
   I have also heard of Blackmagic as a brand for cinema quality equipment. It's a company that has a good reputation.
