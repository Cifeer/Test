      <h2>Personal Information</h2>

      <p>My name is Cody Sadler. I am 19 years of age.The only prior study
         I have had was through primary and secondary school where I was there
         for years 1-12 however I didn't fully pass year 12 because of my difficulty
         studying through 2020 covid.However while i was at school i did happen to
         complete a Cert III in screen and media. I am currently studying intro into IT
         (Information Technology) through RMIT Universities online via Open Universities.
         My hobbies include; Technology repairs and teardowns, exploring all aspects of
         filmmaking and the production of a film or television show, consuming film, shows,
         anime and games is what i'm most likely doing throughout the day.
      </p>


      <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>

      <p>My interest in IT started relatively early in my life when I first started using a computer.
         Pretty much I was hooked on anything technology from the hardware of PCs and old gaming consoles
         used to the software they were using and the code that made the apps, games and websites I use daily.
         Until only recently my view on IT has only been as a hobby however since i completed a Cert III in
         screen and media my view changed and saw how i could make it a career. During that course one of the
         assignments was web development. What I found was pretty fun diving further than just HTML and CSS.
         I looked a little into Java just to have some fun. I chose RMIT through Open universities australia
         to pathway into a Bachelor of Computer science. During this course I hope to learn more about the
         other coding languages out there like python and c++.

      <h2>Learning tests</h2>
      
      <p>
         After completing the personality test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">www.16personalities.com</a> i have discovered that i am a Virtuoso/ISTP-A meaning i am Creative and Practical,
         relaxed tending to live in the moment then thinking about the future.<br> However Virtuosos can be insensitive in some situations using logic
         with little emotion even when meeting new people. Virtuosos can be easily bored and tend to dislike commitment,<br> once something is learned and
         understood they will try to move on to something more interesting. Virtuosos also tend to keep to themselves instead of talking to others;
         they would rather prefer silence, which could prove very troublesome when placed into a team.
      </p>

<div id="test2">
      <p>
            The next personality test i completed was the <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">Big Five</a> personality
            test.<br> this test measures the 5 main traits of a personality;<br> Openness,
            Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism
            (OCEAN for short).<br> After completing the quiz these were the results:
      </p>
</div>
<div id="OCEAN">

      <p>
            I Scored highest in Openness which means I tend to like arts and tend<br> to view certain things in an unusual way.<br> The lowest I scored in was Agreeableness,
            tending to have less empathy for others<br> and only focuses all of my attention on me. I am difficult to work in teams with people and tend to cause conflict between other group members.
      </p>

</div>

<div id="learning">

      <p>The third and last test I completed was the Learning styles test  where you answer a 20 question quiz<br> and rate you on the best way you learn either; Visual, Auditory and Tactile.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      
            <p>After completing the quiz i am a visual learner what is 100%
                  True i find it alot easier to learn something when i am shown<br>
                  How to do it rather than just being told audibly.
                   I'm more likely to watch videos and visual media when im
                  Learning or just bored.<br> I can find learning difficult and lack
                  Attention when learning either through text or through audio.
